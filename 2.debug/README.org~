* What is debugger?
  It's a program runs other programs. Why do we need a program that
  runs other program? Debugger is special program, simply way to say
  examines variables change. Yes, we can do this by printf(). But
  there is more things I haven't sed. As program grows we need to
  manage memory, add functions, call library functions, copy stufs,
  delete stufs etc.. . Using printf bloats our code and doesn't solve
  all problems. That is why there is tool called gdb, that helps us
  to find bugs and solve issues systematic way, and also its free.
