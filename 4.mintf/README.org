** Variadic functions
   As array can be variable sized (dynamic arrays), functions may take
   variable number of parameters. That means there is situations we
   cant guess how many parameters we will send to process to a
   function.
** printf
   In C with simple form of variadic function we can handle same data
   type with any nomber of parameters. For different types we handle it
   adding format specifier, like ~"%d"~, ~"%s"~, like we do with
   function printf.
